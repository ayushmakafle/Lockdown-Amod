    <body>
    <p>  Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses), and others that can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are yet to be vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. 
      Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria. They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 27 to 34 kilobases, the largest among known RNA viruses. The name coronavirus is derived from the Latin corona, meaning "crown" or "halo", which refers to the characteristic appearance reminiscent of a crown or a solar corona around the virions (virus particles) when viewed under two-dimensional transmission electron microscopy, due to the surface being covered in club-shaped protein spikes.

      <h2 class="alert-heading">Transmission </h2><hr>
 
  Human to human transmission of coronaviruses is primarily thought to occur among close contacts via respiratory droplets generated by sneezing and coughing. The interaction of the coronavirus spike protein with its complement host cell receptor is central in determining the tissue tropism, infectivity, and species range of the virus. The SARS coronavirus, for example, infects human cells by attaching to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.

  <h2 class="alert-heading">Symptoms </h2><hr>


 <p>
Basically the virus remains Dormant for normally for 7 days.They become active after a week.
 The symptoms are:
<li> Fever </li>
<li>Dry Cough</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Trouble breathing or shortness of breath</li>
<li>Ongoing chest pain or pressure</li>
<li>Cannot wake up</li>
<li>Bluish lips or face</li>
If you are exposed and infected, symptoms can show up in as few as 2 days or as many as 14. It varies from person to person.

  <h2 class="alert-heading">Preventive Measures </h2><hr>

  <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water, or clean them with an alcohol-based sanitizer. This kills viruses on your hands.</li>
  <li>Practice social distancing.</li>
  <li>Donot touch your face. Coronaviruses can live on surfaces you touch for several hours. If they get on your hands and you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, they can get into your body.</li>

  <h1 class="alert-heading">Procedure to make home made Sanitizer and Masks. </h1><hr>

<h2>Homemade Sanitizer:</h2>
<li>Clean your hands with Soap and Water to prevent from infection. </li>
<li>Take a clean empty container.</li>
<li>take a half cup of spirit.</li>
<li>take two  full spoon of aloe vera.</li>
<li>Add 2-3 drops of essential oil.</li>
<li>Mix it well.</li>

<h2>Reusable Masks:</h2>
<li>Clean your hands with Soap and Water to prevent from infection..</li>
<li>Take a clean piece of fabric.</li>
<li>Cut the fabric of length 20cm and breadth 17cm. </li>
<li>Fold 1cm from each  two oppsite end of fabric and sew it. </li>
<li>Likewise fold 5 cm from one end from length and sew it until it ends to another length. </li>
<li>Take two elastic band and sew it to two opposite breadth.</li>
<li>The masks is ready to be used.</li>
