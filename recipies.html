 <h5> 37 Recipes That Freeze Really Well</h5>
<p><img src="images/manicotti.jpg" width=400px><br>
There are some days that you get on a roll with cooking and have more food than you know what to do with. When you're feeling particularly motivated, make big batches of recipes that freeze well, and stow away leftovers for when you need to take a break. These soups, stews, lasagna, empanadas, pie dough—and much more—are some of our favorites to freeze.

 <h5>86 Comfort Foods for Cold Nights, Broken Hearts, and Wednesdays</h5>
 <p>
 <img src="images/pork-ragu-over-creamy-polenta.jpg" width=400px><br>
 When you’re fending off the feels (you *know* the ones), the only thing that’s really proven to help is lots and lots of comfort food. (Okay fine, a pile of blankets does wonders, too.) We’re talking rich, aromatic chicken tikka masala over rice, fall-apart-y cabbage as inviting as a cashmere sweater, soups so soothing it warms your soul as much as your belly—and oh, tons of carbs. This is not the time to pretend like you want to eat a bright, zingy salad. You don’t. The heart knows what it wants, so do yourself a favor, and get cooking.

 <h5>81 Leftover-Friendly Recipes to Get You Through the Week</h5>
 <p>
 <img src="images/sambolognese-ramen-noodles.jpg" width=400px> <br>
 We love cooking! But that doesn’t mean we always have the time (or...energy) to cook every single meal every single day. That’s when we turn to the recipes that are not only delicious right after serving, but also as leftovers a day (or three, or four) later. Think stews that get better with age, roasted salmon that’s just as satisfying right out of the fridge, and lentils that won’t mind another day in their marinade. These leftover recipes aren’t just about dinner tonight, but the meals we can actually look forward to again—and again.
